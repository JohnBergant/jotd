# Joke of the Day (JOTD) Service

A Spring Boot application that serves jokes, including a daily featured joke. This service provides a RESTful API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting jokes, with special endpoints for random jokes and the joke of the day.

## Features

- üåû **Joke of the Day**: Automatically selects and caches a daily joke
- üîí **Secured Endpoints**: Authentication for content management
- üìù **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete jokes
- üìä **Actuator Endpoints**: Monitor application health and metrics
- üìö **OpenAPI Documentation**: Interactive API documentation with Swagger UI

## Technologies

- **Spring Boot 3.4.5**: Application framework
- **Spring Security**: Authentication and authorization
- **Spring Data MongoDB**: Data persistence
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: Monitoring and metrics
- **Lombok**: Boilerplate code reduction
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: API documentation
- **MongoDB**: Document database

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Gradle 8.x (or use the included Gradle wrapper)
- MongoDB 5.x or higher (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jotd.git
cd jotd
```

### 2. Configure MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is running locally on port 27017, or update `application.properties` with your MongoDB connection details.

For a local MongoDB installation:

```properties
spring.data.mongodb.host=localhost
spring.data.mongodb.port=27017
spring.data.mongodb.database=jotddb
```

Make sure you run the mongo docker image

```bash
docker compose up -d 
```

For MongoDB Atlas:

### 3. Build the application

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

## Running the Application

Start the application using Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev'
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Default Credentials

To make elevated API Requests and API Key is needed. A default one is setup in the properties file.

**Note**: This should only be used for development purposes
Before going to production this should be replaced with an authentication method that does not expose the secret.
HMAC signing would be a good option or Bearer auth using signed JWTs.

**Note**: These should be changed in production environments.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available via Swagger UI at:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

### API Endpoints Overview

| Method | Endpoint                       | Description                         | Access          |
|--------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| GET    | /api/jokes/{id}                | Get jokeDocument by ID                      | Authenticated   |
| GET    | /api/jokes/daily               | Get jokeDocument of the day                 | Public          |
| POST   | /api/jokes                     | Create a new jokeDocument                   | Authenticated   |
| PUT    | /api/jokes/{id}                | Update a jokeDocument                       | Authenticated   |
| DELETE | /api/jokes/{id}                | Delete a jokeDocument                       | Authenticated   |

## Security

The application uses Spring Security with API Key based Authentication. Two levels of access are provided:

1. **Public Access**:
   - Joke of the day

2. **Authenticated Access**:
   - All CRUD operations on jokes

To secure production deployments:
- Change default credentials
- Use HTTPS
- Consider implementing JWT for stateless authentication
- Restrict CORS settings to trusted domains

## Development Guidelines

### Implementing new features

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Decisions on architecture

#### Java framework

Opting to go with Spring Boot as it is a well-known product with a vast amount of documentation to help with bootstrapping a new service.
It offers robust libraries for interfacing with different storage and a strong security suite. It also offers a great set of tooling for 
making a service production ready through the actuator libraries from health checks to monitoring service vitals.

### Datastore

Opting to go with MongoDB for the datastore. The date will be used as the key for the document.
Joke and description will be part of the document. Initially we won't support searching on anything other than the date.
The daily nature of the records aligns well with the key based lookup and having a document store enables flexibility for adding new features to the joke.
Also I've wanted to explore MongoDB for a while and this seemed like a decent opportunity to work with the DB and expand my knowledge.

### Running tests

```bash
./gradlew test
```
